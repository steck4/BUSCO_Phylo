This is a modified set of scripts for the use of BUSCO in phylogenetics

Additional scripts related to Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO)

For the tool itself: https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco


This folder contains scripts to extract BUSCO genes from several BUSCO run folders (! having used the same BUSCO dataset) and produce a species phylogeny.
You will also find here a Dockerfile to build a container that contains BUSCO and other tools needed for this analysis.


Dockerfile: build a Docker container able to run the script. (see https://www.docker.com/what-docker) (BUSCO is included if you need it. But not required to run the phylogenomics script. Use python3, not python, within the docker to run BUSCO)

run.sh: the main script to proceed to the phylogenomics analysis. The final output is final.nwk

extract_buscos_phylo.py: the main script to identify and extract BUSCO sequences

fetch_best_sequence.py: an additional script required by the previous one

superalignment.py: it fuses all single gene alignement together

config.ini: BUSCO configuration to be used within the container

You will need to adapt several scripts for your own use, each files are commented. For feedbacks and help, please use the main BUSCO gitlab project: https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco

BUSCO main gitlab repository: https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco
